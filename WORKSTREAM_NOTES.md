# Workstream notes — scheduler (cron) + VM

Ownership: `internal/core/cron.go`, `internal/core/crond.go`,
`internal/shell/cron_cmds.go`, `tests/cron_test.go`.
No other file is edited by this workstream (and no git commands were run).

## The one integration hook, and why it does not need a shell.go edit

`World.CronTick()` lives in `core` and must run a real game command line, but
`internal/shell` imports `neohome/internal/core`, so `core` cannot import
`shell`. The dependency is inverted with a one-function registration, declared
in `core` (this workstream's file) and satisfied in `shell` (this workstream's
file) — so **no change to `internal/shell/shell.go` was needed**:

```go
// internal/core/cron.go
var CronExecFn func(w *World, d *Device, u *User, line string) (int, string) // rc + captured output
func SetCronExec(fn func(w *World, d *Device, u *User, line string) (int, string))

// internal/shell/cron_cmds.go
func init() { core.SetCronExec(execCronLine) }
```

`execCronLine` builds a real `Shell` with `NewShell`, runs the line through the
package's own unexported `execOne` (same builtins, same VFS permission checks,
same `>`/`>>` redirects, same `&&`/`;` grammar as a player's session) and
returns the numeric exit status. No host process, no goroutine, no real clock.

If a future refactor wants this without the registration indirection, the
equivalent hook inside `shell` would be one exported wrapper:

```go
func RunAsJob(w *core.World, d *core.Device, u *core.User, line string) (int, string)
```

Nothing else in the workstream depends on it.

## What the scheduler does

* `seedCron(w)` (called by `world_init.go`) registers a real cron daemon unit on
  every device — `crond` on BusyBox images, `cron` on Debian-family ones —
  starts the ones a real box of that type runs at boot (household PC, router,
  NAS, assistant node, NPC router), and plants three jobs in real spool files
  under `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/<user>`.
* `World.CronTick()` (called once per `World.Tick()`, i.e. once per 30
  simulated seconds) reloads the spools, notices daemons that have just come up,
  and fires every entry whose next minute `World.Sim` has passed. No wall-clock
  sleeping anywhere; `tests/cron_test.go` proves firing by calling `Tick()`.
* A job only fires while its device's daemon is `running`. `service cron stop`,
  `systemctl stop crond` and a crashed daemon therefore genuinely stop scheduled
  execution, and starting one re-arms from now (no backlog stampede).
* Every run appends to the device's `/var/log/syslog` (so `logread cron` /
  `journalctl -u cron` show the command, the exit code and the first line of its
  output) and to `/var/log/cron.log`, and world events get the first run of
  each job.
* `crontab -l | FILE | -r | -e [-u user]` operate on the real spool file;
  a bad schedule is refused with its line number and nothing is installed.
  `crond` starts/loads the scheduler and is honest on an image that ships none.

## Seeded jobs (all world-visible, all diagnosable)

| device | user | schedule | command | why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pc-alex` | alex | `0 * * * *` | `curl -s -o/home/alex/upstream-probe.log http://mirror.neohome.example/debian/Release` | FAILS while the planted DNS fault is active ("could not resolve host") and succeeds after the router is repaired — the scheduler hands the player the first clue |
| `nas-alex` | root | `0 3 * * *` | `curl -s -o/srv/data/nightly-mirror.log http://mirror.neohome.example/debian/Release` | "the nightly backup stopped" is a real, traceable failure |
| `asst-alex` | assistant | `*/30 * * * *` | `echo assistant-heartbeat >> /home/assistant/jobs.log` | a real file that really grows; visible with `assist tasks` |

## Two fidelity bugs found in other files — and fixed

Both were found by this workstream but live in files it does not own. They were
fixed independently in `2f53472` (the cron commit itself), so the entries are
kept here only as history — **do not re-fix them**:

1. `internal/shell/net.go` `httpFetch` only understood the attached `-oFILE`
   form; `curl -s -o /path URL` and `wget -O /path URL` mis-parsed the path as
   the URL. **Fixed**: the arg scan now handles the separated forms too — see
   `internal/shell/net.go:349-362` (`-o`/`-O`/`--output` take the NEXT arg;
   `-oFILE`/`-OFILE` stay attached).
2. `internal/shell/shell.go` `commandExists` gated BusyBox applets on
   `s.Dev.OS.Shell == "/bin/ash"`, but `OSInfo.Shell` is written as `"ash"`, so
   `busyboxHas` was dead. **Fixed**: the check now goes through
   `core.IsBusyboxShell(s.Dev.OS.Shell)` (`internal/shell/shell.go:334`), which
   accepts both spellings via the shared `bbSet` applet list.

## Not implemented on purpose

* `@reboot` / `@daily` and friends: refused by the parser with a clear error
  rather than half-supported. A spec the scheduler cannot honour is never armed.
* `-` (Vixie overlap guard) parses and stays armed: a job here completes inside
  the tick that fires it, so there is no previous run to overlap with.
* `MAILTO` / job mail: the game's "mail" is world state, so job output goes to
  the device log and `/var/log/cron.log` instead of inventing a mailbox.

## Status (updated 2026-10-03)

Verified against `aaa2990` (the state-aware-assistant + MCP tip):

* All three seeded jobs are exercised by `tests/cron_test.go`
  (`TestSeededCronJobsAreRealAndDiagnosable` and the `TestCron*` family), and
  the whole suite is green: `go test ./tests/` → 93 tests pass.
* The two fidelity bugs above are no longer open — both were fixed in
  `2f53472`. Re-check with: `grep -n 'IsBusyboxShell' internal/shell/shell.go`
  and `sed -n '349,364p' internal/shell/net.go`.
* Live chain: `bash tools/all_verify.sh` runs the 12 end-to-end scripts
  (live, ssh, wan, live_full, vm, power, dhcp, key, persistence, history, tmux,
  perm). Note both `all_verify.sh` and the individual scripts hardcode
  `cd /workspace/neohome` — fine here (the repo is cloned at that path), but a
  clone elsewhere needs the `cd` overridden first.
